About the Font Manager macro:
A good 80% of it was done using AI.
It works only on Windows and maybe only on a recent version of it.
From what I understand, it's possible to use wxWidgets to make it work on all OS, maybe I'll try in the future.
I find it extremely useful, so I plan to add more features to make it like a proper font manager.
